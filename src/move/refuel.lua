function M.refuel_at_station(refuel_station_coordinates, target_fuel_level, force_move)
    -- Refuel turtle at a designated refuel station, ensuring round-trip capability.
    --
    -- Smart refueling with safety-first logic:
    -- 1. First tries to refuel from items already in inventory
    -- 2. Checks if current fuel is sufficient for round trip to station (distance Ã— 2)
    -- 3. If sufficient, returns early without traveling
    -- 4. Otherwise, navigates to refuel station
    -- 5. Retrieves fuel from chest and refuels to target_fuel_level
    -- 6. Tries multiple fuel types (coal, charcoal, coal blocks, lava buckets)
    --
    -- This ensures turtle never gets stranded - always maintains enough fuel to
    -- return to the refuel station from current position.
    --
    -- Args:
    --     refuel_station_coordinates: Table with {x, y, z} of chest location with fuel
    --     target_fuel_level: Number, fuel level to reach when at the station
    --     force_move: Boolean, if true will dig through obstacles during navigation
    --
    -- Returns:
    --     success: Boolean, true if has round-trip fuel or reached target level
    --     message: String, status message or error description
    --
    -- Example:
    --     local fuel_station = {x = 100, y = 64, z = 200}
    --     -- Refuel to 10,000 when at station, but only go if needed
    --     local success, msg = refuel.refuel_at_station(fuel_station, 10000, true)
    --     if success then
    --         print("Safe to continue: " .. msg)
    --     else
    --         print("Fuel critical: " .. msg)
